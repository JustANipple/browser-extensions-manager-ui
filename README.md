## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Vue
- TailwindCSS
- DaisyUI components
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was my first time with DaisyUI. I found it very practical and i managed to save a lot of time having ready to go components for this challenge

### Continued development

I'll be exploring pre built components for better accessibility and customization

### Useful resources

- [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/components/) - This helped me creating accessible and ready to go components
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-vite) - This helped with the inline styiling for faster development
